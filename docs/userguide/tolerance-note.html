<td>
Distance tolerance (that is, the minimum distance between pairs of atoms of different
molecules) may differ from one system to another. Particular cases that may need additional
attention are:
<br><br>
<li> Coarse-grained models: of course, since the models are not atomistic, the distance tolerance
desired might be larger than that generally used for atomistic systems. However, this is not always
the case, as the usual tolerance may well be large enough to guarantee a proper initial packing
of the system. Since version 15.133 you can use different radii for different atoms, and this
can be useful in these cases as well.
<br><br>
<li> Cyclic systems: Some users have observed that with the 2.0 Angs tolerance some cyclic systems
(toluene, for example) may eventually get linked during packing. If you observe that kind of behaviour, 
a small increase on the distance tolerance probably will solve your problem. You can also try to
increase the initial tolerance by using, for example, 
<br><br><tt> discale 1.5 </tt> 
<br><br>as an additional
keyword. In this case, the packing will start with a 1.5 times greater tolerance, thus probably 
avoiding overlaps, and will only progressively reduce the final tolerance to the actual
desired value (usually 2.0 Angs).
